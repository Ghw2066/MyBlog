## Characterizing Big Data

#### The 3 Vs of Big Data

- **Volume**

  - Challenges for traditional IT infrastructures

  - Large amounts of data, low capacity to process it
  - Distributed technologies: Filesystems and computation (e.g. Hadoop)

- Variety
  - Diverse sources of data (not just relational)
  - Text, image, videos, sensor data, etc.
  - Big data integration and curation challenges
  - Flexibility in data representation

- Velocity
  - Internet/ mobile: Faster creation and consumption of data
  - How to keep up with the pace of it?
  - Streaming processing -> (pre)analyze data it arrives

#### Other Vs for Big Data

- veracity
  - how much can u trust that data
  - data -> quantity + quality (trust)

- Visibility
  - The state of being able to see ot be seen - is implied
  - not enough for information to "exists". It should be visible to the right person
  - Information silos -> Important roadblocks in the extraction of value from data

- Value
  - Holy grail of big data -> main goal
  - data in and of itself has no real value
  - does it justify the effort/ investment
